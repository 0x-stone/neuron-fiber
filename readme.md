## Getting Started

Follow these steps:

1. [Install](#install)
2. [Usage](#usage)
3. [Algorithm](#algorithm)
4. **[Review Example Code](https://github.com/rainlst/neuron-fiber/tree/master/example)**

## Install

```
$ npm install neuron-fiber --save
```

## Usage

```es6
const Perceptron = require('neuron-fiber')

/**
 * input
 * eg
 * [0, 0, 1, 0]  match output [0]
 * [0, 1, 1, 0] => [0]
 * [1, 0, 1, 0] => [1]
 * [1, 1, 1, 0] => [1]
 * ..
 * each case has one matched output 
 * we should know the realtion between input and output which call weight
 * use neuron.w will show you weight after training data every time 
 * 
 * predict is the function can use weight to generate a output accoding to your training data(input and ouput)
 * 
 * .
 */
const x = [
  [0, 0, 1, 0],
  [0, 1, 1, 0],
  [1, 0, 1, 0],
  [1, 1, 1, 0]
]

/**
 * output
 */
const y = [
  [0],
  [0],
  [1],
  [1]
]

/**
 * training times
 */
const times = 1000


/**
 * data is never seen before
 * 
 */
const data=[[1, 1, 1, 1]]


/**
 * begin to train 1000 times
 */
const neuron = new Perceptron(x, y, times)


/**
 * result is predicted
 * result is generated accoding to weight , also data case never appear before.
 * why we call it predict 
 */
const result = neuron.predict(data)


```

## Algorithm
* Define variable  n(Learning rate)  which is produced by deriv sigmoid
* Define variable  Y(result) generated by sigmoid ( 0 or 1)
* Weight update : W(j) = W(j) + delta W(j)
* Delata W(j)= X(j) .* (Y-Y') * n
